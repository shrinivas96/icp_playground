This folder contains a minimum working code version of the playground that was ../icp_testing.

In the ext/ folder there are some projects/libraries that came from other sources. It is often purged so there might not be things that once were there. 

Currently (04.06.23) there is a git repository of a [basic scan matcher](https://github.com/salihmarangoz/basic_scan_matcher/tree/main). This repository is very minimal and very easy to follow along. Contains a ros package to scan mathc. 
Can be useful to teahc yoursself how scan matching works and to improve some coding skills.
